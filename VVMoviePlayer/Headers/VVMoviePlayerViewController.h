/**
 \brief Default view controller that wraps a VVMoviePlayerController

 The VVMoviePlayerViewController class implements a simple view controller for displaying full-screen VolarVideo movies. Unlike using an VVMoviePlayerController object on its own to present a movie immediately, you can incorporate a movie player view controller wherever you would normally use a view controller. For example, you can present it using a tab bar or navigation bar-based interface, taking advantage of the transitions offered by those interfaces.
 
 To present a VolarVideo movie player view controller modally, you typically use the presentMoviePlayerViewControllerAnimated: method. This method is part of a category on the UIViewController class and is implemented by the Media Player framework. The presentMoviePlayerViewControllerAnimated: method presents a movie player view controller using the standard transition animations for presenting video content. To dismiss a modally presented movie player view controller, call the dismissMoviePlayerViewControllerAnimated method.
